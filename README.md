# Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set Classification

## Breast Cancer Diagnosis Based on Cell Nuclei Characteristics

The certain way to diagnose breast cancer is sampling from the mass and looking at it under the microscope. In this project, I have tried to predict whether a mass is Benign or Malignant based the characteristics of the cell nuclei observed in FNA sample. To carry out this study, I have used the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set (*). We trained several classic classification algorithms as well as ensemble methods on this data set, and our best model achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test set. Moreover, this model could achieve a projected mean accuracy of 96.85% with a confidence interval of [0.9443, 0.9843] at 95% conâ€€dence level which is very promising.

This project was initially intended as the course project for my Data Mining course during my master's studies.
